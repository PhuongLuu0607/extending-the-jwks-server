# JWKS Server with SQLite â€” Project 2 (CSCE 3550)

This project extends the basic JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) server by adding **SQLite persistence** for RSA private keys.  
It demonstrates secure database usage, JWT signing, and RESTful key serving â€” while maintaining protection against SQL injection.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Use **SQLite** (`totally_not_my_privateKeys.db`) to persist RSA private keys.
- Ensure keys remain available across server restarts.
- Implement secure, parameterized queries (no string concatenation).
- Expose two REST endpoints:
  - `POST /auth` â€” issues a valid JWT.
  - `POST /auth?expired` â€” issues a JWT signed with an expired key.
  - `GET /.well-known/jwks.json` â€” returns public JWKS of all valid keys.
